SCREW YOUR NEIGHBOR - REFACTORING PLAN
==========================================

Based on analysis of the 1,236-line monolithic ScrewYourNeighborGame.js file, here are the 5 biggest tasks for cleanup and improvement:

## 1. **Extract Game Logic into Separate Modules**
Break the massive component into focused modules:
- **`/hooks/useGameState.js`** - All useState hooks and game state management
- **`/hooks/useMultiplayer.js`** - localStorage/sessionStorage sync, polling, and player management
- **`/services/gameLogic.js`** - Pure functions for game rules, card dealing, player turns
- **`/services/cardUtils.js`** - Card creation, shuffling, rendering, and value calculations
- **`/services/playerUtils.js`** - Player positioning, turn management, neighbor logic

## 2. **Split UI Components into Atomic Components**
Create reusable UI components:
- **`/components/GameSetup.js`** - Setup screen with create/join forms
- **`/components/WaitingRoom.js`** - Waiting room with player list
- **`/components/GameTable.js`** - Main game table with players positioned around it
- **`/components/PlayerCard.js`** - Individual player display with chips and cards
- **`/components/GameControls.js`** - Turn controls (Keep/Exchange buttons)
- **`/components/RoundResults.js`** - Round results display

## 3. **Implement Proper State Management**
Replace massive useState soup with structured approach:
- **Use `useReducer`** for complex game state transitions
- **Create action types** for all game events (DEAL_CARDS, PLAYER_ACTION, END_ROUND, etc.)
- **Centralize state updates** to prevent inconsistencies
- **Add state validation** to prevent invalid game states

## 4. **Clean Up Multiplayer Synchronization**
The current localStorage/sessionStorage approach is fragile:
- **Extract sync logic** into a dedicated hook or service
- **Implement proper conflict resolution** for simultaneous actions
- **Add connection state management** (connected/disconnected players)
- **Remove debug console.log statements** scattered throughout
- **Simplify the complex polling logic** with cleaner state reconciliation

## 5. **Remove Debug Code and Improve Error Handling**
Clean up development artifacts:
- **Remove all debug divs** showing internal state (lines 1024-1036, 1121-1124, etc.)
- **Remove console.log statements** throughout the code
- **Add proper error boundaries** and user-friendly error messages
- **Implement input validation** for game creation/joining
- **Add loading states** for async operations

## IMPACT
The refactoring would transform the current 1,236-line monolith into approximately 15-20 focused files, each with a single responsibility. This would dramatically improve maintainability, testability, and code reusability.
